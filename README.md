- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hayley (@haypurcell)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning to code and potentially making a career change into database management/data analytics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics, and have rudimentary knowledge of SQL, shell script, and Python. Currently, I am continuing my exploration of Python, as well as working on some smaller scale projects regarding data manipulation.
